{"name":"Delta Laser","tagline":"Server Repository","body":"##Welcome##\r\nDeltaControl is still its alpha stage. It has not yet been tested with any Android or Web-Based client. The major goal for DeltaControl is to relay commands from a mobile device to a control system that manipulates the motors and carriages on a delta robot via GCode. Generally, some sort of device that is capable of running Python and has a USB port is required to run the server. There are libraries needed from the [Printrun](https://github.com/kliment/Printrun) open-source package for this server to run.  A robot controlled with a RepRap (Marlin, Repetier, etc) firmware loaded board is required. In our case, we have an Arduino Mega with a RAMPS (Reprap Arduino Mega Pololu Shield) and Marlin firmware controlling the 3 stepper motors of a delta robot. The RAMPS has an SD attachment, this will hold all the GCode routines. Which routines will be executed depends on the client communicating with the DeltaControl server.
