##  @package pyDeltaServer
#   A server script written in Python that sends GCode commands
#   to a delta robot.
#
#   The commands sent to the robot are determined by selections made on an 
#   Android or Web-Based client.  The delta bot will have G-code G-code 
#   compatible firmware installed on its control board.  This script uses 
#   Printrun libraries provided by kliment on GitHub.
#      
#   The server begins by waiting for a client.  When a client connects, the 
#   server will attempt to connect to a printer on /dev/ttyACM0.  If this 
#   fails, it will attempt to connect to a printer on /dev/ttyACM1; it is 
#   possible that the device name will change from either one of these.  If 
#   neither one of these attempts succeed, then the server will begin with 
#   no printer connection.  This is especially useful for debugging client
#   to server communication without having to connect to a control board.
